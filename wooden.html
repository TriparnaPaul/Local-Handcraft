  <h1 class="text-big"> DECOUPAGE EARRINGS MADE WITH MOD PODGE </h1>


  <img class="pic_2" src="Handcraft 9.jpg" alt="">


  <p class="text-small">It’s been awhile since I’ve made a pair of decoupage earrings, or any piece of decoupage
    jewelry, actually. When I spotted these spring earrings from Maggie, I realized that I need something to do with the
    large amount of wood circles that I have in my stash.
    And this wood craft would be perfect! I could make several pairs for myself and for my mom (Mother’s Day is coming!)
    in one fell swoop. They’re great as handmade gifts for anyone who loves jewelry. I like them even for teacher
    appreciation gifts.
  </p>

          It's great for all types of crafts and kid's projects. Easily cleans up with soap and water when wet.</p>

        <p>Acetate paper is a transparent paper that is commonly used in scrapbooking and card making. It's
          mildew-proof, easy to cut, and inexpensive.
          Some pocket pages and page protectors (used to store and protect layouts, photos, ephemera, and more) are made
          with acetate as well.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Primarily used to attach a clasp to a chain or a drop to an earwire, jump rings are the go-to finding when
          cold connecting two items together.
          I've shown employees how to solder a jump ring onto a finished chain when the links were too small to thread
          through and I've blogged about that, as well.</p>

        <p>Snipe nose pliers, also known as chain nose pliers are a great universal plier to have. Use them for opening

      <div class="content">
        <p>For drilling holes in steel that's 1/8 in. or thicker, use cutting fluid or a multipurpose oil like 3-IN-ONE.
          Lubricating the bit reduces friction and heat buildup, which makes drilling easier and your bits last longer.
          For easier-to-drill metals like aluminum, brass or cast iron, lubrication isn't usually necessary.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Depending on how they've been sharpened, pencils can create fine point detailed work or harsher and border
          strokes and shading.
          On the other hand, drawing with a pen can save time, especially if you get bogged down by little mistakes and
          stop to erase every minor error.</p>

    <p>Here are the findings that used, just for reference. If you’ve never used a jewelry tool before, it’s quite
      simple.
      The trick is to be gentle and slow when bending any metal piece so it doesn’t break. </p>
  </h3>
  <img class="pic_4" src="Handcraft 11.jpg">

  <h3 class="text-small_4">
    <p>Out of the wood circles, select the size that you want for your earrings.
      You can go smaller, larger, or do multiple sizes together.</p>
  </h3>
  <img class="pic_5" src="Handcraft 12.jpg">

  <h3 class="text-small_3">
    <p>Trace the circles onto the back of scrapbook paper. Then cut them out with your knife or scissors.
      Alternatively, if you have circle punches the correct size, you can use those.
      I find if I’m always making something of the same size, punches are nice. </p>
  </h3>

  <img class="pic_4" src="Handcraft 13.jpg">

  <h3 class="text-small_5">
    <p>Add Mod Podge to both the wood circle and the back of the paper. Place the paper down on the wood and smooth.
      Wipe away any Mod Podge that comes out the sides and let dry for 15 – 20 minutes. </p>

    <p>Then apply a top coat. Let that dry. </p>

    <p>If desired, repeat on both sides. I recommend that for longer earrings as they have more of a likelihood of
      spinning. Let your circles dry completely. </p>
  </h3>

  <img class="pic_6" src="Handcraft 14.jpg">

  <h3 class="text-small_3">
    <p>Drill holes into your wood circles toward the top edge.
      Use your jewelry tool to attach your jump rings and earring wires as shown. </p>
  </h3>

  <img class="pic_4" src="Handcraft 15.jpg">

  <h3 class="text-small_6">
    <p>The variety of options for customizing these Mod Podge earrings is – endless really!
      I’m tempted to dig through my paper collection and make about 1,000 pairs of earrings. </p>
