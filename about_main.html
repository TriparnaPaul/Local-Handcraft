              Jane Doe is the fourth studio album by American metalcore band
              Converge, released on September 4, 2001 by Equal Vision Records.
              The album was produced by Matthew Ellard alongside guitarist Kurt
              Ballou, and the artwork was designed by lead vocalist Jacob
              Bannon. It was the band's first album to feature bassist Nate
              Newton and drummer Ben Koller, and the last to feature guitarist
              Aaron Dalbec; Converge's line-up has remained stable since.
              Although Jane Doe did not chart, it was a commercial breakthrough
              for the band and received immediate acclaim, with critics praising
              its poetic lyrics, dynamics, ferocity and production.[5][6][7] It
              has since been listed as one of the greatest albums of the
              metalcore genre by various publications, and has developed a cult
              following, with the cover art becoming an icon of the band. A live
              version titled Jane Live was released in 2017.
